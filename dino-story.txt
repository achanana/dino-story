Dino Story
By: Aditya

Chapter 1
---------
A long long time ago, a ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex named Teresa lived
next to a river in a swampy, smelly jungle. According to her neighbor
Terry the Pterodactyl, Teresa was the meanest dinosaur in the whole
jungle. Teresa spent most of her time stomping through the dense
undergrowth, roaring at smaller dinos that got in her way.

Chapter 2

But something caused Teresa to change her ways. She became friendlier and everyone started loving her. Now Terry also loves Teresa.
